# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This project was my first dive into refactoring code on a finished website. Specifically, I was tasked with making this website more accessible and increasing search engine optimization as a result. Accessibility of a website is extremely important for those vision imparements or who require other assistance in navigating the internet. This was accomplished by creating semantic HTML elements and properly ordering them to make the code more readable. I learned how to identify possible accessibility issues and fix them with the best web develpment practices. I also gained experience in consolidating repetitive code and making it more consise while retaining functionality.
